## homework for school

I hate homework so I dont want to make anything about it 

### via InfluxDB

**Data collection**, or IOT devices and user behaviorial events collection, can be formulated as **time series** or **events** and and stored in **times series database** ([TSDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-database/))

a time series or event can be in the form of

```
measurement tag fields timestamp
```
andd an example as
```
temperature,device=device1,buidling=b1 internal=80,external=18 1443782126
```
